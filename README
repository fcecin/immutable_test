eosio1.8.3: binaries and ABIs for eosio 1.8.3 contracts

uxcontracts: binaries and ABIs for UX Network contracts

fakeuxprods: producing node with 21 producers + eosio that should contain a UX 4.0.4 leap build under fakeuxprods/leap/... that has immutability commented out (i.e. a malicious node)

uxnode: non-producing, honest UX node that will connect to fakeuxprods. should have a honest, regular ux4.0.4 build under uxnode/leap/... 

---

test order:

-start fakeuxprods
-boot fakeuxprods
-elect bps for fakeuxprods
-start uxnode
-for every immutability feature, test it

example immutability feature test (set contract (set code + set abi)):
-compile a testcontract
-set contract testcontract (these operations should be done through the fakeuxprods HTTP/transaction port, which should be 127.0.0.1:8888 if it wasn't changed)
-change testcontract source (any change)
-recompile testcontract
-set testcontract account immutable
-set contract testcontract (producers node "fakeuxprods" accepts it, observer "uxnode" obviously malfunctions at the block height where the illegal transaction is rolled into a produced block)
