This will contain a leap/ subdir with the CORRECT ux4.0.4 build WITH immutability.


Also the config.ini for a REGULAR NODE that isn't a producer, and that has the peer address of the fakeuxprods node.


This node has to know things went horribly wrong when the 21 producers mutate an immutable contract.

-------

How to generate the leap/ directory:

git clone --recursive https://github.com/cryptomechanics/ux-leap-bls    (OR any other source of UX Leap sourcecode)
mv ux-leap-bls leap
cd leap
git checkout ux4.0.4    (or ux4.0.4-bls if you want to include code that won't trigger)
git submodule update --init --recursive
(cmake, make, etc. to generate it under leap/build/...)
